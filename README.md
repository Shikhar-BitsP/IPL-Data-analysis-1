# IPL Data Analysis
<br>I have taken **inspiration** for this analysis as well as the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZkleSo1uaNiSjqpqSyAHJWdl9HAYNJEy/view?usp=sharing) from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbS5z-j4dd0&t=282s&ab_channel=Simplilearn).

<br>
Please note that this far from being a 'copy-paste' work and it took days to finish as this analysis as I was learning data analysis as well as implementing the data analysis concepts simultaneously.

<br>
I have only sought to answer the questions asked in the aforementioned [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbS5z-j4dd0&t=282s&ab_channel=Simplilearn) and nothing else.

(All steps have been explained using markdown cells within the jupyter notebook.)
